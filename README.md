# propartner

This project was build during a campus hackathon in my college. We had given to build something unique so I tried to locate people on Google Map. 

This app helps you to find programmers around your location or anywhere in the world accourding to filters. Even you can add yourself to this app so that other programmers near your home could find you and contact you in case of any help.
